                <p>Born to Harish and Rama Bhanot on 7 September 1963 in Chandigarh, she was the darling of her family, which included two brothers, all of whom called her their ‘lado’. She studied in Chandigarh and later in Mumbai, which was where she became
                    a model, endorsing brands like Binaca toothpaste, Forhans and Godrej. </p>

                <p>At the age of 19, she was married to a marine engineer and moved to Sharjah, UAE. After two months of abuse, including starvation, verbal taunts and threats, Bhanot left her husband, returned to Mumbai and decided to become a flight attendant.

            <h2 class="heading ">About The Hijacking Story</h2>
            <div class="para ">
                <p>On 5 September 1986, Neerja Bhanot was on duty in the Pan Am Flight 73, parked on the tarmac at Jinnah International Airport in Karachi, preparing for take-off. The flight was flying from Mumbai to USA, carrying 361 passengers and 19 crew
                    members. All of a sudden, four armed men barged into the aircraft. Acting quickly, Neerja alerted the cockpit crew who evacuated the plane. Being the senior most staff on the hijacked aircraft, she took charge.</p>

                <p>The hijackers—part of the terrorist Abu Nidal Organization backed by Libya—wanted to fly to Israel and crash the plane against a building. But it was not possible as the cockpit crew had already escaped. The passengers on the plane hailed
                    from different countries, there wereIndians, Germans, Americans, and Pakistanis, among others. The terrorists were more intent on targeting the Americans. When Neerja was told to collect the passports of the passengers, she hid the
                    American ones so that the terrorists could not identify them.</p>

                <p>The nightmare on the aircraft continued for long. The hijackers opened fire after 17 hours, prompting<b> Neerja open the emergency door. She could have escaped first, but chose not to.</b> Instead, she helped the passengers escape. She
                    was shot when she was shielding three children from the terrorists’ bullets after hours of saving the lives of several hostages.</p>
